# Phase 5 Implementation Summary: Dashboards, Reporting & API Integrations

## Overview
This document summarizes the implementation of Phase 5, chunks 5.3-5.5, which added advanced filtering, CSV export capabilities, a generic external API integration framework, and Jira integration for ticket and SLA data.

## Chunk 5.3: Advanced Filtering & Basic Reporting

### Backend Enhancements

#### 1. Advanced Filtering DTOs
- Created `QueryClientDto`, `QueryContractDto`, and `QueryFinancialDto` with support for:
  - Full-text search across multiple fields
  - Field-specific filtering (company name, contact info, status, etc.)
  - Date range filtering
  - Numeric range filtering
  - Multi-column sorting
  - Pagination

#### 2. Enhanced Service Methods
- Updated `ClientsService.findAll()` to use QueryBuilder for advanced filtering:
  - Case-insensitive search
  - LIKE queries for partial matches
  - Date range queries with Between operator
  - Dynamic sorting and pagination
  - Returns paginated response with total count

#### 3. CSV Export Implementation
- Added CSV export functionality using `papaparse` library
- New endpoints: `GET /clients/export/csv`, etc.
- Features:
  - Applies same filters as list endpoints
  - Configurable column selection
  - Proper HTTP headers for file download
  - Date-stamped filenames
  - Role-based access control (ADMIN/MANAGER only)

### Frontend Integration

#### 1. Enhanced List Components
- Updated `ClientsList.tsx` with:
  - Advanced filter panel (collapsible)
  - Search input for full-text search
  - Field-specific filters
  - Date range pickers
  - Status dropdown
  - Clear filters functionality

#### 2. CSV Export UI
- Added "Export to CSV" button with:
  - Permission-based visibility
  - Loading state during export
  - Automatic file download
  - Success/error toast notifications

#### 3. Pagination Implementation
- Server-side pagination with:
  - Page size controls
  - Previous/Next navigation
  - Total records display
  - Current page indicator

## Chunk 5.4: External API Integration Framework

### Framework Architecture

#### 1. Core Components
- **IntegrationConfigService**: Manages API credentials and settings
  - Environment-based configuration
  - Support for multiple auth methods (API Key, Bearer Token, Basic Auth)
  - Custom headers support
  - Per-integration timeout and retry settings

- **BaseIntegrationService**: Abstract base class for all integrations
  - Common HTTP methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE)
  - Automatic retry logic with configurable attempts
  - Standardized error handling
  - Request/response logging
  - Authentication header building

#### 2. Module Structure
```
backend/src/modules/integrations/
├── integrations.module.ts
├── services/
│   ├── integration-config.service.ts
│   ├── base-integration.service.ts
│   ├── sample-api.service.ts
│   └── jira.service.ts
└── controllers/
    ├── sample-integration.controller.ts
    └── jira.controller.ts
```

#### 3. Sample Integration
- Implemented `SampleApiService` using JSONPlaceholder API
- Demonstrates:
  - Extending BaseIntegrationService
  - Implementing typed API methods
  - Data transformation
  - Aggregating data from multiple endpoints
- Controller with secured endpoints and role-based access

### Key Features
- **Modular Design**: Easy to add new integrations
- **Type Safety**: Full TypeScript support with interfaces
- **Error Resilience**: Automatic retries and graceful error handling
- **Security**: All endpoints protected by JWT authentication
- **Configuration**: Environment-based settings for each integration

## Chunk 5.5: Jira Integration for SLA & Tickets

### Jira Service Implementation

#### 1. Data Models
- **JiraIssue**: Complete issue structure with custom fields
- **TicketSummary**: Aggregated ticket statistics
- **SLASummary**: SLA performance metrics

#### 2. Core Functionality
- **Issue Search**: JQL-based searching with field selection
- **Client Mapping**: Uses custom field (cf[10050]) for client ID
- **SLA Tracking**: 
  - Time to First Response (customfield_10030)
  - Time to Resolution (customfield_10031)
  - Breach detection and achievement rates

#### 3. API Methods
- `getClientIssues()`: Fetch all issues for a client
- `getClientTicketSummary()`: Aggregated ticket stats
- `getClientSLASummary()`: SLA performance metrics
- `getHighPriorityTickets()`: Critical/High priority issues
- `getSLABreachedTickets()`: Issues with SLA violations

### Dashboard Integration

#### 1. New Endpoints
- `/integrations/jira/clients/:clientId/tickets/summary`
- `/integrations/jira/clients/:clientId/sla/summary`
- `/integrations/jira/dashboard/summary` (multi-client aggregation)
- `/integrations/jira/tickets/recent`
- `/integrations/jira/tickets/high-priority`
- `/integrations/jira/tickets/sla-breached`

#### 2. Data Aggregation
- Parallel fetching for multiple clients
- Calculated totals across all clients
- Error handling for individual client failures
- Performance optimization with batching

### Frontend Integration Points

The Jira data can be consumed by existing dashboard components:
- Ticket Status widgets display real-time Jira data
- SLA Performance charts show achievement rates
- Drill-down functionality to view detailed tickets
- Client 360 view includes ticket history

## Security Considerations

1. **Authentication**: All endpoints require JWT authentication
2. **Authorization**: Role-based access control for sensitive operations
3. **API Credentials**: Stored securely in environment variables
4. **Data Filtering**: Clients can only see their own data
5. **Rate Limiting**: Configurable timeouts and retry limits

## Configuration Requirements

### Environment Variables
```env
# Integration Framework
INTEGRATION_TIMEOUT=30000
INTEGRATION_MAX_RETRIES=3
INTEGRATION_RETRY_DELAY=1000

# Jira Configuration
JIRA_ENABLED=true
JIRA_BASE_URL=https://company.atlassian.net
JIRA_USERNAME=email@company.com
JIRA_PASSWORD=api-token

# Custom Field Mappings
# cf[10050] = Client ID
# cf[10030] = Time to First Response
# cf[10031] = Time to Resolution
```

## Testing Recommendations

1. **Unit Tests**:
   - Test filter query building
   - Mock external API responses
   - Validate data transformations

2. **Integration Tests**:
   - Test with real Jira sandbox
   - Verify CSV export format
   - Test error scenarios

3. **Performance Tests**:
   - Load test with large datasets
   - Measure API response times
   - Test concurrent exports

## Future Enhancements

1. **Additional Integrations**:
   - ServiceNow for ITSM
   - Slack for notifications
   - Microsoft Teams integration

2. **Advanced Features**:
   - Scheduled data synchronization
   - Webhook support for real-time updates
   - Custom field mapping UI

3. **Reporting Enhancements**:
   - PDF export option
   - Scheduled report generation
   - Custom report templates

## Deployment Notes

1. Install required packages:
   ```bash
   npm install papaparse @types/papaparse
   ```

2. Configure environment variables for Jira

3. Set up Jira custom fields for client mapping

4. Test integration endpoints before enabling in production

5. Monitor API rate limits and adjust timeouts as needed
