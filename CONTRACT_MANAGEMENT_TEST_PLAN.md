1. Test date validation:
   - Contract end date before start date
   - SAF dates outside contract period
   - Proposal dates in future
2. Test numeric validation:
   - Negative prices
   - Zero quantities
   - Extremely large numbers
3. Test string validation:
   - Very long contract names
   - Special characters in names
   - Empty required strings

**Expected Result**:
- All validation rules enforced
- Appropriate error messages
- Data integrity maintained
- No SQL injection vulnerabilities

## ðŸ“Š Test Execution Guidelines

### Manual Testing Approach
1. **Sequential Execution**: Run tests in order as later tests depend on earlier ones
2. **Data Cleanup**: Reset test data between test runs
3. **Browser Testing**: Test on Chrome, Firefox, Safari
4. **Mobile Responsiveness**: Verify UI works on mobile devices
5. **Performance**: Monitor response times for large operations

### Test Data Management
- Use consistent test data across all test cases
- Create setup scripts for test data initialization
- Implement cleanup procedures for test isolation
- Document test data dependencies

### Error Documentation
- Screenshot all error conditions
- Document exact error messages
- Note browser console errors
- Record network request/response details

### Success Criteria
- âœ… All positive test cases pass
- âœ… All negative test cases fail appropriately
- âœ… RBAC enforced correctly for all roles
- âœ… File uploads work securely
- âœ… Data integrity maintained
- âœ… Error handling graceful and informative
